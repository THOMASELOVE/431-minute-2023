## Minute Paper Assignments for 431 in Fall 2023

During the semester, Professor Love will set a series of ten "minute papers" which are brief surveys asking you to help us better understand how the class is going, and to let us remind you of some things. The first Minute Paper is due after Class 3. Minute Papers are always due on Wednesdays, at noon.
